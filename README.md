Questions:
Think about your portfolio, and what purpose it can serve for you- whether you are looking at it for a job, or university.

3) Tell me what your aim is... and whether or not you feel your portfolio is going in the right direction to related to your goal...
   
My overall goal is to study engineering in college and in order to complete that goal I need to geer my porfolio in order for that to be appealing. Me being
in computer science automatically looks really good as well as me adding some of the coding projects I have done. In my opinion all those things are taking
me in the right direction to meet my final goal. Although my portfolio needs updating and some work it has the right basics and foundation.

4) What sort of things could you add to your resume/project that you think could help you reach your goal?

   Any oppertunites that have some relation to engineering such as coding projects or coding programs, working on aviation or one of my passions that
   conects with engineering. Also I know nasa runs some camps in town which would also look really good. Although colleges look for all rounded students its
   important to show what you have done in your field of passion which is why some of those things would help me and take my portfolio in the right direction.
